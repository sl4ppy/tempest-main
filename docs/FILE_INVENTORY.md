# Tempest: File and Module Inventory

This document provides a complete inventory of every file in the Tempest source code repository.

## 1. Source Code Files (`.MAC`, `.V05`)

These files contain the 6502 assembly source code for the game. The `.MAC` extension denotes files for the `MAC65` assembler.

| Filename | Purpose and Dependencies |
| --- | --- |
| **`ALCOIN.MAC`** | **Coin Handling:** Manages coin insertion, credits, and the coin-op mode settings. It is part of the main game logic. |
| **`ALCOMN.MAC`** | **Common Data:** A header or include file (`.INCLUDE`) containing common memory address definitions, macros, and constants shared across multiple source files. |
| **`ALDIAG.MAC`** | **Diagnostics:** Contains code for the hardware self-test and diagnostic routines. (Note: Not listed in the main linker command in `TEMPST.DOC`, may be for a separate test ROM). |
| **`ALDIS2.MAC`** | **Display List Management (v2):** Responsible for constructing the vector lists that are sent to the Vector Generator hardware to be drawn on screen. This is a core part of the graphics engine. Version "2" likely indicates an iteration. |
| **`ALDISP.MAC`** | **Display List Management (v1):** An earlier version of `ALDIS2.MAC`. |
| **`ALEARO.MAC`** | **Enemy Logic (A-E):** Appears to contain logic for some of the game's enemies. The "ARO" might be a naming convention for a group of related modules. |
| **`ALEXEC.MAC`** | **Main Executive:** The central file that contains the main game loop and coordinates calls to all other modules. It is the entry point of the game logic. |
| **`ALHAR2.MAC`** | **Hardware Interface (v2):** Handles direct interaction with the game hardware, such as reading controller inputs (rotary dial, buttons) and DIP switches. |
| **`ALHARD.MAC`** | **Hardware Interface (v1):** An earlier version of `ALHAR2.MAC`. |
| **`ALLANG.MAC`** | **Language/Text:** Likely contains data and routines for displaying text on screen, possibly for multiple languages or just for the English text used in the game. |
| **`ALSCO2.MAC`** | **Scoring (v2):** Manages player score, high score table, and awarding extra lives. |
| **`ALSCOR.MAC`** | **Scoring (v1):** An earlier version of `ALSCO2.MAC`. |
| **`ALSOUN.MAC`** | **Sound:** Contains the code to trigger and control sound effects and music via the sound hardware. |
| **`ALTES2.MAC`** | **Test Mode (v2):** Code for the operator's test mode, which is used to check hardware components and game settings. |
| **`ALTEST.MAC`** | **Test Mode (v1):** An earlier version of `ALTES2.MAC`. |
| **`ALVGUT.MAC`** | **Vector Graphics Utilities:** Provides utility functions and subroutines used by the display list management code (`ALDIS2.MAC`) to manipulate vector data. |
| **`ALVROM.MAC`** | **Vector ROM Data:** Contains the raw vector shape data for all game objects (player, enemies, text, etc.). This is the data that the Vector Generator hardware reads to draw shapes. |
| **`ALWELG.MAC`** | **Welcome/Attract Mode:** Contains the logic for the "attract mode" or "welcome" sequence that runs before a game is started. |
| **`ANVGAN.MAC`** | **Animated Vectors:** An include file providing macros or data related to animated vector objects. |
| **`ASCVG.MAC`** | **ASCII Vectors:** An include file containing vector data for drawing ASCII characters. |
| **`COIN65.MAC`** | **Coin Handling (Shared):** A common include file with routines and macros for coin management, used by `ALCOIN.MAC`. |
| **`HLL65.MAC`** | **High-Level Language Macros:** An include file providing high-level macros to simplify common programming tasks, simulating higher-level language constructs. |
| **`MBUCOD.V05`** | **Mathbox Microcode:** Source code for the auxiliary "Mathbox" processor, which handles complex calculations. Version "V05" indicates the revision. |
| **`STATE2.MAC`** | **Vector Generator State Machine:** Source code for the Vector Generator's state machine ROM (`STATE2.SAV`). This is not 6502 code, but microcode for the VG hardware itself. |
| **`VGMC.MAC`** | **Vector Generator Macros:** An include file with macros specifically for interacting with the Vector Generator hardware. |

## 2. Data and Configuration Files (`.DAT`)

These files store data used for verifying ROMs or for other steps in the development process.

| Filename | Purpose and Dependencies |
| --- | --- |
| **`002X1.DAT`** | **Verification Control File:** A data file used by the ROM reader/verifier tool to check the integrity of the Version 1 ROM set. Referenced by `TEMPST.DOC`. |
| **`002X2.DAT`** | **Verification Control File:** A data file used to verify the Version 2 ROM set. Referenced by `TEMPST.DOC`. |
| **`MABOX.DAT`** | **Mathbox Verification Control:** A data file for verifying the Mathbox ROMs. |

## 3. Build Output and Executable Files (`.COM`, `.LDA`, `.MAP`, `.SAV`)

These are the output files generated by the assembler and linker, or final ROM images.

| Filename | Purpose and Dependencies |
| --- | --- |
| **`ALEXEC.COM`** | **Executable Command File:** A command file used to automate the build process. |
| **`ALEXEC.LDA`** | **Linked Executable (Alternate):** The final, linked binary for one of the alternate versions of the game. This is the file that would be split and burned onto the Program ROM chips. |
| **`ALEXEC.MAP`** | **Memory Map:** A linker-generated file showing the memory addresses of all labels and symbols in the `ALEXEC.LDA` binary. Essential for debugging. |
| **`MBOX.SAV`** | **Mathbox ROM Image:** The binary ROM image for the Mathbox subsystem. |
| **`MBUCOD.COM`** | **Mathbox Build Command:** Command file to assemble the Mathbox microcode. |
| **`MBUCOD.MAP`** | **Mathbox Memory Map:** The memory map file for the Mathbox code. |
| **`STATE2.COM`** | **State Machine Build Command:** Command file to assemble the VG State Machine code. |
| **`STATE2.MAP`** | **State Machine Memory Map:** The memory map for the VG State Machine code. |
| **`STATE2.SAV`** | **State Machine ROM Image:** The binary ROM image for the Vector Generator's state machine. |
| **`TEMPST.LDA`** | **Linked Executable (Main):** The final, linked binary for the primary version of the game. |

## 4. Documentation Files (`.DOC`)

These files contain human-readable documentation.

| Filename | Purpose and Dependencies |
| --- | --- |
| **`MBUDOC.DOC`** | **Mathbox Documentation:** Documentation specifically for the Mathbox auxiliary board. |
| **`TEMPST.DOC`** | **Project Documentation:** The main documentation file for the project, containing hardware information, memory maps, source file lists, and build commands. This is the cornerstone of the original project documentation. |
